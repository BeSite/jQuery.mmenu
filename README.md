jQuery.mmenu
================

The best jQuery plugin for app look-alike on- and off-canvas menus with sliding submenus for your website and webapp. It is very customizable through a wide range of options, extensions and add-ons and it will always fit your needs.

**However since its accessibility is kinda shitty, I'm forking it to improve it.**
